# ShieldOS Documentation

Official documentation for ShieldOS, a decentralized personal security operating system built on Solana.

This repository will contain architecture overviews, module specifications, cryptography notes, integration guides, and public-facing technical documentation.

## Contents

Planned structure:

/docs
/overview # high-level introduction and concepts
/architecture # system design, flows, and diagrams
/modules # mail, drive, vault, chat, id, ai
/security # threat models, security assumptions, disclosures
/integration # SDK and API integration guides
/roadmap # milestones, changelogs, release notes


Documentation format and tooling (static site generator, CI, etc.) will be defined during early iterations.

## Goals

- Provide clear technical context for developers and auditors
- Document design decisions, especially around privacy and cryptography
- Offer integration guides for teams building on top of ShieldOS
- Maintain public transparency about the state and direction of the system

## Status

Early stage.  
Content will be added progressively as ShieldOS modules stabilize.
